VERY IMPORTANT, READ THIS!
Test test, Alex here.


Now the file is in github, remember to stage changes once they are made.

Alright, so github/kraken is confusing as well.. The folder where all these files are is the repository, changes made to it get reflected here. So if you place a notepad in the repository (folder)
then you'll be able to find those changes on github. You need to click on the thing saying WIP and make a comment or whatever detailing the changes.
On the right, you'll be able to stage changes with a button saying stage changes. It means save changes, it is annoying but think of it as the save button. Then at the bottom right
make sure to click committ changes. Now everyone will be able to have access to these changes. Yay.

If you are reading this on GitKraken, you may wonder how to leave this file, don't worry I did too. CTRL + S will save your stuff. Make sure to stage changes. If you want to add
some whatever file, type CTRL + P for the command prompt then add a file. You cannot upload a notepad or project file like this however. To upload a file, just place said file into
the folder (what we call the repository).

After pressing CTRL + S. you'll be able to stage (save the changes).
